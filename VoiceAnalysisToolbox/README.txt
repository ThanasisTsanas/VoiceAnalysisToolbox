
Before using the Voice Analysis Toolbox, you will need to download software from other researchers (third party software). I apologise in advance for complicating the user?s task, but this is an easier way to adhere to different licence issues. 

To facilitate this process, I have included the function “setup_voice_analysis_toolbox” which the user should run on a machine which is connected on the Internet to download the required files. If the authors of the third party software move their functions, the user may have to manually download the required functions from the authors' websites. 


In short:
1) the first time you use my toolbox run: "setup_voice_analysis_toolbox.m" 
2) use the main function "voice_analysis.m"

This should provide you with the speech signal processing outputs which can be used to assess vocal quality.
